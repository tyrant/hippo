    Seven muscular-looking hippopotamuses thrashed their burly way up and out of the waters of the Rio Orinoco, the river bordering Venezuela and Colombia, its muddy waters streaming down their bodies, noon sun glaring harsh on their skin, heads replete with great floppy hammer-and-sickle berets. The hippos stomped forth on rear legs only, for in their midst struggled a gigantic caiman crocodile, legs wiggling, jaw snapping, yet pincered secure between forelegs and under armpits. With their sergeant bellowing “Heave, comrade-privates, heave!” the hippo troupe bodily hefted the beast squelching through deep sucking mud, up and over the river’s banks and onto a sort of grassy plateau area, a clearing in the steaming jungle. Hippos and many other animal species trotted over it in busy groups, carrying other animals, vegetation, building materials, the works. Other clearings could be spied not far off, and from them came bangy construction noises and brayings of animal labour.    Comrade-Private Sanchez grasped caiman foreleg under one arm and did his damndest to haul his weight. Pull, pull! Come on, we can get our prize back to camp, I’m sure of it! What does Sarge keep saying? Viva revolution, right? He panted and puffed and felt his tummy rumbling after the morning’s meagre breakfast and wished there’d been more to gobble. Still, that’s what Command must have meant when they spoke of Noble Sacrifices for the Greater Good, right? Of Brave Comrades All, of, er, Making Revolution? Making Revolution is good, isn’t it? He set his jaw and tried to feel like the Heroes Of The Revolution that fat old hippo from last night bleated at us about, reading from that book and distributing that ambrosia-powder-stuff for us all to sniff up and reinvigorate. What did she say? Be worthy of, um, Comrade Stalin? I think? I wonder who this Stalin bloke is? All the elders speak of him like his tusks could cleave the entire world in two. He must be amazing. His tummy rumbled again. He felt a hollow, light-hearted feeling in his innards, wished once more for a nice juicy meal, then decided that such selfishness was unworthy of a Hero Worker. Several other caimans followed the group exiting the water, hopeful for a snappy bite of hippo meat, but a few dozen well-aimed kicks sent them sprawling back with a hefty splash.    “Easy does it, comrade-privates,” bawled their sergeant, “those caimans are our future allies. In time, they too will stand tall beside us, comrades in arms,” he roared. “In time they too will take up the mantle of permanent revolution aargh get out of it you dirty bugger!” This to a hitherto unseen caiman now clamped snarling around his back leg.    He shook and danced and kicked with his three other legs but failed to detach it. It flashed its eyes at him and dug deeper. “Argh!” he howled. “Get this bloody thing off!”    His subordinates dropped their reptilian cargo and clustered around their leader, wringing their hands and looking helpless. Sanchez’s thoughts whirred. Quick, the Oracle library back at the mansion! Whoever wrote all those books knows everything – oo, I know –    “Stick a pen up its ass!” he at last bleated. The others turned and stared at him. He opened and shut his mouth a few times. “It works on dogs, doesn’t it?” he stammered. “Why not caimans?”    “You damn fools!” their sergeant hooted. “Our caiman’s getting away!” And so it was, on its feet in a trice, slithering back to river safety at top speed. “Comrade-private Sanchez, get it!”    Sanchez yelped, leaped sideways and divebombed the thing, bam. “Got it sir!”    “Nice work, comrade-private,” moaned the sergeant. “Shit, these jaws, lucky our skin can stop bullets or I’d be in real trouble … what did you say, comrade-private? A pen? What?”    Sanchez paused again, feeling a wee bit nervous. “I don’t rightly know what a pen is, sir,” he ventured, “but a book in the Oracle library had a passage about, if you get attacked by a dog, you-”    “Hold it,” snapped the sergeant. “What’s, argh, a dog, comrade-private?”    “Er, those furry snuffly things we found in the zoo, sir! The one and only animal our Ambrosia powder has no effect on?”    “Oh those things! See, comrades, if we pool our knowledge – argh – there is no intellectual height we cannot – shit – scale. Dogs, now biros – go on…”    “So the book,” said Sanchez, feeling rather out of his depth but yearning to help, “says should a ‘dog’ attack you, simply insert a ‘pen’ and it pisses off.”    The sergeant regarded him stonily. “And you don’t know what a pen is.”    “Uh no sir.” Shit.    “Right.” Sarge stared back just a little too long. “And no-one else does? No? Try - aah - a stick, then.”    “Maybe that’s what a pen is, sir!” wheedled another hippo. “An anti-bitey stick?”    “Could be!” said another. The remaining troupe chattered with agreement and fanned out and scrounged up a stick of the appropriate width. Shove. Detach. Success.    The sergeant leapt to his feet and gave the caiman an almighty kick. It tumbled some metres and plopped back into the river. “Bloody ingrate! Enemy of the Proletariat!” the sergeant roared after it, blasting the air with his rage. Trees slapped backwards. “We’re here to HELP you entitled bastards!” He rubbed his leg. “Damned kulak. One more for the troika lists, eh comrades? Eh?” He cackled. “Good work, comrade-private!” the sergeant nodded at Sanchez. “Stalin would be proud. There’ll be an extra helping at dinner for you.”    A great big dollop of pleasure washed over Sanchez. I did it! I did it! he squeaked to himself. I Made Revolution!    “Now where were we?” their sergeant rumbled to himself. “Ah yes. Shoulder our future comrade-caiman!” The troupe hefted their snappy passenger, only slightly bruised from its Sanchez-squishing. “Onward!”    The caimanned troupe blundered its way across the jungle clearing, up a slope of some very recently uprooted rainforest palms, crashing through vine-choked gaps, caiman passenger squirming all the while. Up another slope they stomped, dislodging frisky parrot flocks chattering angrily at them, mostly raw animal noises but a few genuine cries of “Watch where you’re going you rude pricks! We’re trying to have lunch here!”    Off they stomped in the direction of a low ridge some minutes yonder - then down it and through into another jungle clearing, this one much larger, this one a throbbing hive of industry and construction. Dozens of hippos clustered and thronged around broad artificial pools with aqueducted river water entering one end and exiting the other, the better to Maintain Hygiene, most important in a good Communist. A great scarlet banner proclaiming the message Revolutionary Wild Comrade Mustering Station Thirty-Seven flapped in the breeze at one end. Other teams tramped in and out with what looked like half the Amazon rainforest uprooted and flung on their hefty backs. Canopies and root systems and all, the timber teams dumped their leafy loads and chiselled branch and vine detritus off the long poley tree trunks with great jaw-swipes. They scraped miscellaneous vegetation cascading into one massive pile, then dropped trunks into neatly stacked pyramids to dry for future construction. A mixed bag of hundreds of different species formed an orderly queue beyond the lush buffet of the vege pile, predators and prey lining up most civilised, and you could see why – a double line of great burly hippos with nasty-looking sticks and hammer-and-sickle berets flanked each side, and judging from the way they whooshed their sticks around on a regular basis, were clearly champing at the bit to deal serious whacky to the slightest sign of assertion or independent thought. Even as Sanchez tramped past, a condor lost her shit and took a sickening lunge at her toucan neighbour, before a hippo moved fast and clubbed her beak aside. Three hippos were on her in a trice and bundled her away from the queue, while she thrashed helpless in their forearms shrieking “I’m a carnivore you sadistic assholes! I can’t eat your plants, I’m starving!”    “How dare you betray the Revolution!” one of her captors thundered. “Murdering loyal comrades? We’ll weed out you capitalist spies soon enough. It’s a show trial for you, my darlin’!” The other two captors brayed with spittly laughter.    Bloody hell! Sanchez sweated to himself, staring at them. These spies are everywhere! I wonder why capitalists hate us so much? What did we ever do to them? But … can birds really not eat plants? That condor looked so very hungry. Those parrots we passed just back there were gobbling down berries! I don’t get it. His brow wrinkled. What’s wrong with nice yummy bush? As he and the troupe stamped onward, resident caiman wiggling insolently, he mulled the conflicting thoughts over. They should make more of an effort, he decided at last. I can scoff down bush just fine. I can Make Revolution, don’tchaknow? His eyes sparkled at the thought and he chortled to himself, feeling rather proud.    Many of the nearer queue members appeared rather sullen at the condor’s outburst and capture, and tried not to catch anyone’s eye. The bereted hippos alongside them growled and tried to look even fiercer. Those queue members at the front, though, they stumbled forward and leaped upon every last bit of vegetation dumped by the tree-carriers, then fanned out with their new feasts to various long buildings nearby, log-cabin-ish, evidently constructed from last week’s lumberjack labours. Sanchez stared longingly after them, his tummy almost a continuous raw growl.    Still further away across the huge clearing, groups of burlier, more muscular-looking animals, mostly hippos but a few others, panthers, jaguars, more condors, you name it, they queued in another mighty line and clutched at smaller, squirming animals, struggling under captor arms. Difficult to spy out at this distance, but great commotion could be seen at the queue’s head, where additional hippos could be seen handling blindingly white sacks. Every few seconds the queue rippled forward.    The sergeant grinned, a hell of a sight from a hippo. “Does the sight not warm the cockles of your heart?” he trumpeted. “Building Communism! Building Revolution! With luck we’ll blanket the world in no time, praise be to Stalin.” The troupe gave a ragged cheer. “Onward!” He directed his team to the distant queue’s rear.    In no time at all they found themselves near its head. Sanchez stood right up on tippytoes, wondering what the hell was going on in front, trying like hell to strain over the top of some great big fat hippo in the troupe before them, blocking his view. No dice. He pouted. Then, oo, a thought.    “Sergeant? What’s-”    The troupe’s sergeant, grasping the caiman’s other foreleg, growled and snapped at Sanchez. “Comrade-private Sanchez! You will address me by my proper rank!”    Oh shit yes that’s right, “Sorry comrade-sergeant sir!”    “That’s better. Don’t you forget that, comrade-private.”    “Yes sir sorry sir.”    “Indeed. Now, your question?”    “Er yes comrade-sergeant.” Sanchez paused again. “That banner - are there really 37 of these camps here? Where are the others, sir?”    Several other hippos in the troupe tittered. “What!” Sarge thundered. “This was the very topic at our battalion's morning seminar! The Bits Of South America We Have Already Kicked The Shit Out Of, And The Bits We’re About To. Did you not attend it?”    “Er no sir, a group of humans attacked my unit’s shed-”    “-Ah?”    Shit, yes, use the Correct language. “Sorry sir, capitalist pigs sir!” Sanchez bleated. “They attacked my unit’s shed this morning-”    A nearby splutter. “How dare you!” screeched several of a mob of burly bush pigs trotting past, all cactus-thorn hair and crowbar trotters and pneumatic smell, shouldering what appeared to be ill-maintained Kalashnikovs. They too stood replete with great floppy hammer-and-sickle berets, just like the hippo guards. “Nothing wrong with being a pig!” their leader declared, trotting up to Sarge and eyeballing him from a metre below. “Educate your charges!” She nodded at Sanchez like a bar fight headbutt. “Especially that one. I’ve got my eye on you, sunshine.”     Sarge stared right back, apparently unruffled and not giving an inch. “Apologies, comrade,” he rumbled. “The comrade-private here was quoting Stalin himself.”    The bush pig met Sarge’s hard gaze for a few long seconds. “Right,” she said at last. “Stalin, eh? Right. Stalin.” A pause. “You just watch it, sonny boy.” She led her pack off. “This way, my porcine comrades,” she said loud enough for most of the queue to hear, particularly the double guard line. “Command favours us pigs over hippos for the Trinidad-and-Tobago amphibious landings,” she shouted. “Some of us can recognise talent. Some of us aren’t so speciesist!” she spat.    “And some of us have the smarts not to end up as cannon fodder!” roared Sarge, as the pig troupe stomped off and away. “Fools,” he said to their backs. “Dead by tomorrow, you mark my words.” The nearest queue guards cackled at this. “Our Revolution’s only three weeks old and already bits of it are going to the dogs not a word out of you lot,” this to a pack of big snarley attack dogs trotting past, great floppy tongues all over the place. “Now – Sanchez – that missed seminar?”    “Yes sir! I couldn’t attend.”    “Hm!” said Sarge. “When were you activated?”    “Right at the Revolution’s start, Sarge! Three weeks ago. ”    Sarge gave Sanchez an appraising glance. “Oh really?” he rumbled. “You were one of our First Fifty, were you?” He gave a bark of laughter. “Now why are you a private? Why not one of the generals leading the assault on Caracas, then?”    “Er dunno sir. Er, what’s a Caracas?”    “Ha, point proved, say no more.” Sarge paused. “Hmm. Sorry lad,” he said, his steel-wool facade dropping for a quick sec. “That was a bit harsh.”    “Er yes sir.” It was? What’s Sarge on about? wondered Sanchez.    “But to answer your question, we’ve got a hell of a lot more than just 37 of these camps. They’re all over the place. Up and down the Orinoco, in the jungle, on seashores, everywhere, sited strategically, sited for recruitment.” Sarge gave their caiman a pat. “I got activated two days into the Revolution’s start, downriver from your plantation-”    “Then me!” burbled another of the troupe, behind Sanchez. “And me!” said another.    “You will not interrupt a superior officer,” said Sarge, but without any malice. He grinned. “But how many hippos are there in all of South America? A few hundred? Maybe more in zoos? Can’t launch worldwide revolution with a pittance like that. So we vacuum up brother and sister soon-to-be-revolutionaries like this bad boy here.” He gave the caiman another cuff. It twitched. “And we Activate them, and millions more just like it.” Sarge glared at the heaving swarms of biological comrade-dom bombarding the food pile to their left like the world’s screechiest waterfall. “And now we have an army! Too bloody uppity by half, though. We’ve let a lot of riff-raff in, far too much, you saw those cheeky piggies giving you lip. Once we’ve got a nice stable State we’ll put a stop to that - but big sturdy reptiles like our friend here are welcome any day. That answer you?”    “Yes sir!” Sanchez felt his brain fizzing with questions. First, though, “Er, but what-”    “Right, we’re here,” harrumphed Sarge. “In good time, comrade-private. Squa-aaad! At the ready!”     Before them was a raised granite platform, standing square about a metre above the clearing jungle grass, with crude, broad stone steps ramping up each face. Great scarlet banners stood proud atop it, flapping in the equatorial breeze, emblazoned with the standard hammer-and-sickles and majestic photos of jhippo yawns. Exiting stage right bustled the hippo group previously ahead of them in the queue, formerly holding a wild cobra coiled around their limbs like wool, but now they slapped the comrade-snakey on what passed for its back and invited it, Sanchez couldn’t help but eavesdrop, for a nice drinkie down the local boozer. Wouldn’t mind that myself, he mused. His tummy went all squirmy again.    Remaining on the platform itself waddled about thirty hippos in crimson ceremonial robes with pictures of – Sanchez stared closer – I dunno, some old human, on them. Nice moustache. About two thirds of them clamped large-print I Heart Commies and Ceiling Cat Iz Watchin U Undrmyn Bawjwarzee propaganda posters under their forelegs. Others held dusty sacks and trowels. A mighty mound of extra sacks piled at the platform’s rear, ringed by the largest hippos Sanchez had ever seen. Crack, ha, bodyguards. The robed hippos seemed to be divided into several groups, each group handling one queue member at a time. Ragged crowd of assorted hollow-eyed animals frothed around nearby, hooting and braying, staring at the things with yearning, hopeful looks. Every few seconds one would summon up desperate courage and try sproinging up and over the guards and divebomb the sack pile nostril-first, but as Sanchez watched, one after another after another was snatched mid-air by one or more hippo guards and found themselves hurled back into the surrounding jungle at high speed. A distinct floury carpet dusted much of the platform.    The nearest enrobed hippo group stared for a wee sec at Sanchez’s troupe. Their leader scratched its nose. “Approach us,” one mumbled. It sounded like a throaty asthmatic tomb. “Get a move on mate … hell of a queue behind you.”    Sarge stamped forward, swelling with pride, using his caiman cargo to tug-o-war his underlings forward also. He snapped to razorbacked attention, vibrating with military zeal, with an almighty effort thrust his chest further out than his tummy, windmilled his right foreleg around several dozen times, and finally slammed it against his temple with an audible thwack. “Comrade-general!” he barked. “Comrade-sergeant Garcia reporting, commanding Molar Squad Seven of the 19th Heavy Battalion, the fightin’ Starsnstripes! We-”    “The … what?” wheezed the enrobed hippo. “Explain, my good man.”    “The Starsnstripes, comrade-general,” said Sarge. “We 19thers picked the name by common ballot not two evenings past. Those of Comrade Stalin’s writings still in our possession speak of little else-”    “A most curious name. What, er, does it mean?”    “We are … not entirely sure. Our Oracle library fragments did not furnish us with a definition, only of Comrade Stalin’s passion for it.” Sarge sounded a tad uncertain. Then he rallied. “But we will make him proud!” He thumped his chest, hard. It rippled like that bit in The Matrix when Trinity’s helicopter rammed that skyscraper. “We too will earn his passion for starsnstripes!”    “I … see, sergeant.” Sarge twitched at this. “Your attitude does you credit. Let us take a gander at our new guest.”    “We bring you another glorious comrade!” Sarge barked. “Viva revolution-”    “Yes yes come on,” the general said. “Zap away and then we can have a spot of lunch.” To a subordinate cowering behind it, “Pan-fried alfalfa today, I believe? Indeed? And caramelised lawn clippings for dessert? Superb!” He coughed. “Bring our, ah, guest forward, sergeant.”    Sarge twitched again and hissed slightly, but gave the relevant orders. In a trice the troupe swivelled the caiman on its back and held its jaw firmly shut. The robed hippo dug a generous trowel-load of white powdery stuff from a nearby sack; the hippos with propaganda posters grabbed them steady and held the things over their heads. Sanchez looked at the powder with interest. The Ambrosia! The Activator! Amazing stuff, that. The guard ring sneered at him.    “That’s it, that’s it, hold its jaw shut, good man,” mumbled the general. “Make him breathe through his nose-” He held the trowel steady below the caiman’s nostrils. For some seconds it thrashed and twitched – then inhaled half the trowel in one huge sucking gasp.    The entire caiman thrashed like 50,000 volts straight to the left nipple. It roared and twisted and Hitachi-worthy tremors squirmed through it. Various troupe members got flung tumbling, rolling over and off the granite platform, getting a big braying laugh from the guard ring.    “Now the posters, faster, faster!” the general ordered. “While the Ambrosia reforms its brain, quick!” The hippos holding the posters thrust them back and forth and waved them into the caiman’s flashing eyes, one after another. “That’s it, gentlemen, imprint Comrade Stalin’s teachings, quickly Esparza, bit more of your Crush Capitalist Scum, no no too much, it’s damn near rabid now, Vasquez, flash more Worker’s Paradise, better, now Ortega, your Empower Proletariat sign, superb- ”    The caiman mellowed a tad and started hissing and growling. “sssssarsshhhssarghohbloodyhellssiisaaaahrrghrrrwhatahigh–” Its eyes swam and rolled. My goodness, Sanchez noted, peering into its eye, its head jumping and jiving right next to his face, can I actually see hammer-and-sickles in there…?    Sarge looked on from its other side all satisfied, standing braced, pincer grip on its foreleg. “Yes, that’s it, let the Ambrosia do its work...”    The caiman gave one or two more mighty heaves. Sanchez found himself flung around and up and down like a feather-light yo-yo, but clung to the caiman’s other foreleg nonetheless. Sarge stood steadfast.    Silence.    The caiman stared this way and that, glaring at each troupe member in turn with its great dark eyes. Then, “Which one of you bastards sat on my tail?”    Sanchez froze. “I-”    “First things first. Put our new comrade down, comrade-privates,” ordered Sarge. “Gently!” They did so.    The caiman, four metres of bitey snap, found itself face up and snow-angelling in stale cocaine. “I apologise, sir,” said Sarge to it a tad gruffly, “for the manner in which you were brought here. And for your tail. You may have medical attention shortly-”    It hissed. “I don’t need no stinkin’ medicine,” it snapped. It sprang onto its back, then up and onto its hind legs, bipedal emulation. “Except for that powder. That shit’s the shit.” It looked first the general and then Sarge dead in the eye. “So you boys and girls are … Communists, eh?” It towered over Sarge, shoulders thrust back, forelegs ramrod stiff. “I enjoyed your crash course! Sentience and comradeship for all life-forms and bitey death to capitalist oppression? I’ll totally get behind that. Sign me up!”    “I am … t-the ranking officer here!” stammered the general, discovering their backs were facing him. “You will address me!”    “Cork it, grandad,” said Bitey, over its shoulder. “I-”    “At attention, comrade-private!” bellowed Sarge. “You will not address a superior officer like that!”    The caiman gave Sarge a long cool look. “Who exactly is in charge here? Not you?”    “I am, caiman!” wheezed the general. “I am a member of the First Fifty! The original menagerie members, the first to fall upon the Ambrosia, the first to break our masters’ chains, the first to rise up and fight!”    The caiman turned and faced him and attempted to raise a skeptical eyebrow and discovered the hard way it did not possess eyebrows, skeptical or gullible or snazzy, no, not even huge spiky ones like Ming the Merciless, and settled for opening one eye wider than the other. “Oh?”    The general waved a panoramic foreleg about him, encompassing new recruit queue, feeding troughs, swimming pools, glaring guards, Mt. Coke, dormitories, factories, local boozers, training grounds, weapons dumps, swarming anthills of armies at their eternal war games, and shimmering tropical blue in the distance, the near edge of one of many billion-plant-strong coca plantations stretching to the horizon. “Yes! Oh. If not for me, none of this would be!”    The caiman stared the general up and down and sniffed. “Is that so,” it pondered. “Is that so indeed. You’re first. I see. First. Meritocracy in action. Hm! Isn’t that interesting.” The caiman slouched a tad and scratched its stomach. “All right. Sign me up, general.”    “Good! Yes!” said the general. “As long as that is understood. Take over, Sergeant.” He swivelled his bulk rearward without even the merest whiff of a farewell salute and retreated to his posse. “Lunch time!” His pack dropped propaganda signs right where they were and waddled off in the direction of one of the finer-looking food huts. “That alfalfa won’t eat itself,” the general murmured to one of its underlings. “Yes sir,” it wheedled back, “you work so hard sir, you deserve a nice rest sir…!”    Sarge glared at the retreating group for several long seconds. Sanchez could see his jaw moving a wee bit, seemingly mouthing words, Sanchez couldn’t tell what. Finally Sarge visibly shook himself. “There are times,” he said, apparently to the air, “that I seriously question our leaders’ wisdom. If you’ll come with us,” this to the caiman, “we’ll get you sworn in and equipped and assigned to a work group. This way! Comrade-private Sanchez, take down our new member’s essentials en route. Get its name.”    Shit! Sanchez barely suppressed a yelp. Sarge trotted smartly off the granite platform, shouldering his way through animal crowds trotting everywhere, and off he marched in the direction of another, quite substantial log building some way off, with a banner above it saying STALIN WELCOMES OUR NEW COMRADES and with species of all types milling in and out, those entering having on them their birthday suit and little else, and those exiting bristling with expensive-looking kit and mad grins. The troupe scuttled after their sergeant.    Sanchez began edging closer to the caiman. “…Er, hi!” he began.    The caiman, now scuttling on all fours, snapped its head up at him. “You! It was you!” it hissed. “My tail, back at the river! That bloody hurt.”    “Aah! I’m sorry!” he bleated. “I was just following orders-”    The caiman grinned. “Nah, don’t trouble yourself, kid,” it growled, not unkindly. “All in a day’s work. Say, I’ve got mates back at the river who’d jump at the chance to sink teeth into a few of these capitalist douchebags.” It turned its head this way and that, apparently scanning the nearby animal crowds going about their Revolutionary business. “No? No-one? Shame.”    That’s odd, what’s it playing at? “What are you looking for?” asked Sanchez.    “Oh, me using ‘douchebags’ as an insult made me think of your sergeant talking of capitalist pigs, and then pissing off those actual pigs back here.”    “Oh - so you can still recall your pre-Activation memories just fine?”    The caiman cackled. “Looks like it! Can’t you? But I was saying, you lot haven’t started recruiting actual sentient douchebags, have you? No intelligent hygiene products walking about and mustering bloody Revolution?”    “Ha, no,” laughed Sanchez. “…Hang on.” He frowned. “How does a caiman know what a douchebag is?”    “River tourists talk,” it said darkly. “They talk about all sorts of things. Things that stick right in my craw. Like how the skin of that, ha, alligatory lizard thing sunning itself on that river bank over there would make the most gorgeous boots, dahling. Or how they can’t be bothered hauling around this damn rubbish, oh just chuck it overboard, dump it on the fish.” The caiman grimaced, then chuckled. “Like I said, my mates will be all too keen to sign up.” It gave Sanchez a sly glance. “And how does a hippo know what a douchebag is?”    “I was in a zoo,” Sanchez grumbled. “It was awful. Just throw the leftovers and rubbish in there, they’d shout, the hippos will eat it. Same as you. And we did! We didn’t know any better! Now we’ve risen up and thrown off their yolks. No more rancid eggs! Nice fresh ones.”    “Sorry to hear that, man.” The caiman shook itself like a twisty wet tea towel, squirming with pleasure. “Tell you what, I feel like a new croc! Suddenly I can think! Amazing! What was that stuff that crusty old leader hippo fed me, man? Was that really cocaine?”    “Cocaine?” Sanchez frowned. “What’s that?”    “That powder!” the caiman said impatiently. “River tourists suck the stuff up their noses all the time, every damn day there’s a launch or something motoring past with humans on board inhaling their white powder. Cocaine. That’s what they call it. They shout stuff at each other and fire guns at me.” It gestured at an old graze on its torso. “I picked that up last year. Bloody painful.”    “You call it cocaine?” Sanchez tried to think. “The generals have always called it Ambrosia, or Stalin’s Heavenly Gift, or whatever. That’s been the main goal of the Revolution, you know.”    “What, getting your mitts on cocaine, or whatever-you-call-it?”    “Yeah!” Sanchez felt proud. “Why should humans monopolo- momololo- have it all to themselves? Why should they be the only species able to speak and think? We want our fair share! Animal rights!”    “Gnarly, bruv! Right on!” said the caiman. “Now that’s a revolution I can get behind. I tell you what, if I’d known it’d have this effect on me – and clearly on you and all these thousands of animals around us – I’d have charged aboard the first river boat I’d seen and snapped up the lot. Get it before they do, see how they like not being able to string a sentence together.”    “Oh yes!” said Sanchez. “Back before our dawning, that happened all the time. You should have seen it, especially in the early mornings. The humans at our plantation would hoover it up late at night, stagger to bed – and early the next morning, until their first Ambrosia dose, wow, they couldn’t speak either. Or run around, or anything at all, really. You’ve never seen eyes so bloodshot.”    “Right,” pondered the caiman. “Without their cocaine on a regular basis they’re as mindless as we were! And as I was, just a few minutes ago.” It plodded along in silence for a bit. “No wonder they grow so much of it. It’s grow or perish.”    “I’ve been wondering about that stuff too!” exclaimed Sanchez. “If their Ambrosia makes them what they are - then it must predate them, right?”    “Sounds about right,” said the caiman. “What of it?”    “So-” said Sanchez, “So – the humans didn’t make it, so it’ll occur naturally! Somewhere out there in the jungle, is there, like, a fountain of the stuff-?”    “Comrade-private Sanchez!” bellowed Sarge, quite a ways up ahead. “Report!”    “Oh shit yes that’s right,” said Sanchez. The troupe’s pace quickened towards Sarge, strutting vibrating outside STALIN WELCOMES OUR NEW COMRADES. The animal crowds seemed thicker here. “Quick, Mr. Caiman, for our records, we all need names, we’ll need one for you.”    “A name?” The caiman looked quizzical. “I dunno. I don’t really have a name. Never needed one. Sometimes a few of my mates say ‘Rrrrrarrgh’ at me…?”    “Um, most of us need our own unique names, especially in a Revolution this big, we can’t all be Rrrrrarrgh.”    “True.” The caiman looked all moody. “Well what would you suggest?”    “Report, comrade-private!” Sarge bellowed, louder, over the howls and screeches of the steadily more animated crowd. Squads jogged this way in that, in quite some confusion. That’s odd, Sanchez thought, noting the emotional tones in the air. Hang on, best sort this name issue out first-!    “I don’t know, any name will do!” he wailed. “How about Jim?”    “Jim?” said the caiman. “What kind of a name for a caiman is Jim? No! I’ll-”    “Riverboat-attacker, then!” said Sanchez desperately. “Gun magnet, party-pooper-”    “No no – Maria,” said Maria. “I like the sound of ‘Maria’, good ring to it, some of the frillier boaters called themselves that-”    “Right!” snapped Sanchez. “Comrade-sergeant! Presenting comrade-private Maria!”    “Good work. Comrade-private Maria, report inside for the standard new recruit gear-”    “Comrade-sergeant Garcia!” A hippo stamped through the crowds, shouldering lesser-massing animals aside and saluting Sarge. “Where the hell have you been?”    “Comrade-colonel!” barked Sarge, snapping to attention. “Pardon, sir?”    “Haven’t you heard?” shouted the colonel. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Get back to the 19th headquarters and arm up. The Capitalist scum are counterattacking Caracas!”
