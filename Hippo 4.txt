   “So … I want to be sure I understand you,” I say into Adriana’s hugely magnified face.   “Fire away,” says she.   “Let’s go over this one more time.”   “Please.” She sips her tea like it’s an aromatic Indiana Jones trap and drinking more than a millilitre an hour will unleash universal armageddon.   “So hippos.”   “...Yes, dear. Hippos.” Nano-sip.   “Hippos have overrun Venezuela-”   “And Colombia!” bleats a man down the table from me.   “And half Ecuador!” cries out another, bursting into tears. Oh dear, tipping point, ripples of emotion are bouncing through the meeting. “My homestead, my livelihood, my family, all taken-”   “That pack of floozies wasn’t your family!” snarls a third, glaring from his pint.   “It wasn’t?”   “Of course it wasn’t.” Man 3 swigs, straightening in his seat. “Shouting ‘who’s your daddy’ during your orgies doesn’t count.”   “Oh.” The second man wobbles his lip for a second or two and starts to whimper. “Then-”   “Stay on topic, please!” I shout. Man 2 yelps. “Time for that stuff later! Business first.” Man 3 frowns and nods. “Thank you. If I’m to lop the heads off these all-conquering hippos for you,” I continue, “then we need to cook up a plan. I like their style, they sound rather groovy-!”   Splutters explode up and down the table. Armani-cocooned dandies stare at me aghast. Hah. So do Adriana’s EU chums, milling around either side of her digital visage. A few of the more dignified ones glare at me like they’d caught me rolling spliffs from pages of the Domesday Book. Adriana herself keeps a straight face, but I can see a cheeky smile sparkling away in those eyes of hers. “Groovy?” spits Man 3. He flexes stealth-bomber jaw like he’s crunching diamonds. Look at those cheeks bulge! He’s like a chipmunkey Pierce Brosnan. “Groovy? I would advise you to treat this crisis with the gravitas it merits! Ms - Clements, was it?”   “The same! And believe me I do, babycakes,” I smile, cocking a finger-pistol at him. “That’s why I do my homework. These things take planning. Tell me, have you ever arranged a hit job on a rival outfit’s top brass?”   His eyes narrow at me. He clacks pint glass onto table very deliberately. “As a matter of fact I have.”   A fellow artiste? Groovier! “Then you’ll know,” I say, “of the advantages of groundwork, of understanding your foe, of their security, their motives, of, er, subtle contemplation-”   Adriana snorts like a geyser and slaps hand to bulging mouth. “Not when I’m drinking!” she cries out, plonking down her own emptied teacup and sponging mouth and blouse with napkin. “Subtle? You? That’s a bit rich!” She wrings the thing out. A hugely close-upped staff member on her side of the camera wipes off tea droplets now spackling the camera lens. “Damn you for that. Could I get another?” she says to someone off-camera. “Ta.” To me, “what have you ever done that’s subtle?”   “Oh come on, babe, tons of things.” I ponder for a quick sec. “What about that time you and I sold Baden-Württemburg to Switzerland for an entire week without a single person noticing? That was subtle!”   “That? That ended with Crown Prince Ruprecht personally firing nine hundred and nine depleted uranium rounds up the ass of my getaway Lambo.”   “He did!” I grin at that. “Happy times.”   “Happy? I’m ever so pleased for you,” says Adriana. A servant hands her new tea. “Thanks.” To me, “Getting that car fixed gave nine panelbeaters nervous breakdowns. Nine! And then there was the penis.”   Our bemused onlookers are becoming ever more confused. I can see them from the corner of my eye. “Er - what penis?”   “You know what penis I mean! You melted the bullets down into a metre-tall bust of his own dick-”   “-Oh yeah-!”   “-and mailed it to him. What were your exact words? ‘He’s the sort of guy who, if you told him to go fuck himself, would give it a try’, was it?”   “You got it,” I nod sagely. “His libido and ego deserve each other.”   “…That’s beside the point. You just don’t do subtle, dear.”   “O ye of little faith. You just watch me with these hippos-”   “-Yes! Hippos!” Man 3 spits. He looks like he’s about to explode with impatience. “Return to the topic, ladies! Some trillions of dollars are at stake!”   Hmph, he’s got a point, I have to admit to myself. Amazing fun churning the ol’ nostalgia turbines with veteran chums like Adriana, toasting past glories and egging on those to come, but we do get a bit carried away. Outsiders find it bloody tedious. Serves ‘em right for not being there.   Oh yes, so we’re at a meeting, aren’t we? Quite an important one! Around me, Park Privilege’s senior management sit in gigantic leather armchairs, led by His Halitosisness himself, that Jurassic twit breathing on me back in the lobby, blobbing away in an obelisk-like chair likely to have consumed Texas’s leather output for an entire year. His lieutenants are all hat-and-tails-and-Respectability-cufflinks, outward lacquers of snooty serenity no doubt concealing horrid welters of terror. Ever seen five thousand people undergoing skull-splitting cocaine withdrawal at once? That’s what these ladies and gentlemen will have to babysit their clients through in the very near future, should they and we not sort out this Hippo debacle. Glad I’m not them. The spice must flow!   Much the same impetus propels the thirty or so of the wealthiest clientele able to cram around the Park’s main conference room table. They ooze with cash and self-importance and what they think is astounding fashion sense – and not a few bruises, for the spectator galleries ringing the table are packed and throbbing with dozens more unsuccessful entrants, replete with bruises of their own and restrained by stocky Privilege muscle. They arch their heel and crane over each others’ heads trying to watch the proceedings.   My, erm, ‘colleagues’ to my left and right have a unique set of emotions, more or less a linear function of how much this Hippo business affects them personally. My own personal motto for Park Privilege is “where the world’s wealthiest assholes congregate”, and a good third of those seated here likely mooch their riches from Colombia’s coke fields directly. Or did, until these hippos did their hippo thing. They look like the entire world is exiting their ass directly, much like, I’m guessing, Man 2. He’s snivelling and whimpering and blowing his nose. The other two thirds’ worldly wealth is more likely unrelated, and enjoy their Devil’s Dandruff indirectly. They simply look furious.   At the conference room’s far end is the biggest and crispest TV you’ve ever seen. A-squillion-p, minimum. On it is Adriana’s ugly mug, sitting at a meeting table of her own, flanked by about twenty of her EU diplomat contacts. Above the TV is an HD video camera, relaying my own ugly mug back to them. Save perhaps Park management, they’re doing their stern dignity act far more gracefully than anyone here – a lifetime’s deadly schmoozing amid the globe’s toughest tends to rub off on you. I had first-hand experience of that way back around 2001, when the UN decided enough was enough and cantilevered me out of this sweet little empire I’d carved out almost by accident, halfway up the Congo. Their civil war was sputtering away, I’d only dipped my toe in there to run guns and scram – but my clients’ enemies cut off our exit, so I dug in for a bit, made a few local mates, thought it’d be a hoot to challenge nearby chiefs to an evening of drinking and arm-wrestling contests, bested forty-three straight, and in five minutes flat two million darkies worshipped me as their queen. You know how it is. A thousand sexy strongmen smooching my feet each morning for six months was fucking awesome, but I’ll admit that near the end I got a bit weary of it all. If I enter a pub it’s to sup a nice pint, not for the regulars to literally gut each other to be first in line to prove cunnilingus mastery to The Delectable Cow From Whom All Worldly Bounty Flows (their name for me, no word of a lie). It was almost a relief when fifty giant UN hovercraft roared their way up the jungle river and to my palace, crammed with dignitaries brandishing UN writs declaring I Heart Peace and No More Tyranny. Ten thousand loyal lads rose unbidden to defend their deity, and these spindly paper-pushers faced ‘em down. I’ve never seen anything like it – you haven’t lived ‘til you see an Uruk-Hai begin swinging its mighty axe, get hit head-on from a pencil-neck stare, then drop the thing and scarper. Sturdy folk indeed. I made a good few friends that day. Nevertheless, Adriana’s lot seem bit shaken, for a good few are from behind the former Iron Curtain, and no doubt have vivid memories of actual Communism – for Adriana tells me the Commies are involved somehow, so she invited some along.   “All right, all right,” I flap a hand at Man 3. “Planning. Right. Planning. Notes time.” I pat pockets and snap my fingers a few times. “Anyone got a pen?” I know it’s cheeky, but I can’t help myself. At Man 3, “Could I mooch one of yours-?”   “Enough!” he snarls, and thumps the table. Loud. Cutlery jangles. The noise level drops to silence. “Ms. Clements, is this some kind of sick joke? Park Management assures us-” he glares daggers at the management at one end of the table, who are beginning to look uncomfortable, well, more than usual, “-that you are apparently a competent mercenary. I remain unconvinced. Our livelihoods burn and you crack infantile jokes!”   Oh god, it’s Reagan’s slutty Hitler outfit all over again. Some people just don’t want to loosen up. Best nip this in the bud. “You question my methods?” I purr at him. “Would you like a demonstration?”   “Such as?” he sneers. “A William Tell impression? Shooting an apple off my head will reassure us of your ability to plan entire infiltration missions? I think not!” Rumblings up and down the table suggest that other Park patrons feel likewise.   Adriana gives him a very muted smile indeed. I catch her at it and wink. Ha, there’s her eye-sparkle again. Several EU chums catch me at that and eye-sparkle also. They know what’s what.   Where’d that notebook go… I pat my pockets - ah, there it is. “No, that’s not what I had in mind,” I say, “although it’s not a bad idea. Perhaps later?” I lick a finger and start leafing through it. “What’s your name?”   Man 3 eyes me coldly. “My name is Trent Taylor,” he says, in the manner of someone rather annoyed he has to introduce himself.   “Taylor, eh?” I give my opened notebook a casual eye-flick. “You’re sure you wish a demonstration?”   “Ms. Clements.” Crikey, that’s some James Earl Jones-level subwoofing. “Perhaps you do not grasp the fragility of the ice on which you totter. If your ‘demonstration’ is not world-class, I will eject you.”   Oh it’s on. Almost by itself, my train of thought shunts from one set of rails to quite another. I rub my hands together. “Oh? Be it on your own head then, sugar-slit.” Taylor flushes with anger but doesn’t respond, just kicks up the glare.   The meeting room ripples with chatter at “sugar-slit”, then dies away just as quickly. Taylor, Taylor, flick, flick – here we go. I make great play of reading the thing. I let a pantomime laugh bubble up my throat. Fifty people crane their necks at me. “Oho, you’re the Loathsome Asparagus plantation’s major shareholder?” I ask, looking up from it.   “Yes.” He damn near grinds his teeth. “I am.”   “Geez, that’s right by the Rio Orinoco, it must have been one of the first to fall. Interesting. Curious. Fascinating. How’s Rachel?”   And bam. Taylor’s face strobes from Trump orange to bleach white and back within a second. “I don’t know anyone called Rachel.” His voice and face are steel-galvanised.   “Oh come on, don’t be modest.” I waggle my eyebrows. “She’s a very fortunate lady!” I stand up, then panto-act reading a few more lines from my notebook. “What does this say now… ‘I have never seen a more impressive case’,”  I dictate. “‘Few women indeed have the physical strength to carry 43 full-size gold bars hooked in their negligee in the course of a billionaires’ striptease, let alone manipulate their clients into paying another ten per handjob. Ms. Daniels’ skill at draining foolish clients is unparalleled. She has left a trail of destructive bankruptcies across multiple continents.’” Astonished chatter froths around me. “‘Perhaps her greatest coup was thieving half the assets of the serial philanderer Trent Taylor in 2007-’”   Taylor lurches to his feet, face fury-scarlet. “Enough! Slander! I never met her! You hand over that notebook immediately! Simmons-” he gestures to a beefy bodyguard flanking him “-take it off her! Now!”   I chuckle and frisbee it to him.   He snatches the notebook out of the air and paws through it. He goes all bug-eyed and emits a series of pops. “There’s nothing written h- it’s empty!”   I laugh, hands on hips. “’Course it’s empty! You think I’m foolish enough to record my intel for any old pickpocket to pinch?” I tap my forehead. “It’s all here, baby. I do my homework, see, on you, on anyone I deem significant. You don’t scratch your ass without me knowing. I bet our colleagues here would just love to know what your thirteenth ex-wife thinks of your puny bedroom skills-”   “No!” He shrieks. He hurls my blank notebook at my face. It arcs over the meeting, all eyes on it, then explodes in a confetti sphere. Bam! And now all eyes are on the trusty Beretta in my hand. His bodyguard go all bug-eyed at it, shout in surprise and scrabble at their own gun holsters, pause for just long enough when they realise I’ve vanished my weapon back to the hidden pocket from whence it sprang and I’m now thumbs-upping at them, and Taylor collapses into their arms, faint, out for the count.    “…And there’s my William Tell impression!” I declare. “Satisfied? Yes? Right.” I stare up and down the table, past Taylor’s bodyguard and assorted hangers-on wailing at their master’s woe, around the ring of people clustering the gallery, into the TV at Adriana’s EU chums, and finally at Adriana herself, who’s busying herself with a wee bit of nail-filing and subtle, hah, eye-rolling. “Anyone else care for another homework demonstration? No?”   All of a sudden no-one feels like meeting my eye. Thought not. I sit.   What’s all this? I’m Rain Woman all of a sudden? Spymistress Supreme? Nah. See, you get all sorts in this world. You do indeed get some truly formidable billionaires and suchlike, quite dangerous men and women who are fully aware of anything blackmailable in their past – but, and here’s the difference between them and Clown Taylor here – they know how best to conceal it. They don’t go blabbing to any random nightclub chick (me). And they sure as hell don’t hang out at the likes of Park Privilege, they’re altogether too smart for that. Park Privilege’s jetset are typically absolute morons. Morons who are all too eager to hit the bar and drown their deepest darkest sorrows, discover to their horror that said sorrows spurn a liquid grave and remain cheekily buoyant, first atop a nice pint of stout, then successively in Baileys, tequila, marijuana, absinthe, morphine, acid, crack, ketamine, heroin, bath salts, crystal meth and shortbread, and at around 4am they throw in the towel and eject their undrownable sorrows onto any handy Park patron, which in practice is usually me. So I listen. And listen. And I listen. Then listen some more. To all kinds of hot goss, saucy goss, espionage-worthy goss and goss that’s just plain fun. I keep topping up their tipple, then when I’m all listened out, slip ‘em just a teensy dose of my special-blend Rohypnol so they don’t remember it was me, and next evening the harvest resumes. Reintroducing myself every damn time is tedious but lucrative.   And Taylor’s far from the worst, believe me, but my god that man’s a messy speaker. Honking and braying and hands straying where they shouldn’t, although a bit of Pavlovian conditioning sorted that out pronto. A second or two of me clanking gold bars like Monty Python coconuts and he balls up like a squirrel. ‘Rachel’, hah, made a mint off him.   When I’m not around to suckle their clumsy secrets, these same twits blurt to the Help. I sneak a glance around the room at them, and yup, sure enough, I can spy that telltale gleam in their eyes, they’re feigning the astonishment genuinely shown by everyone else, pretending they’re not already wise to everything I just said.   So that’s the likes of Taylor cowed. “Okay!” I shout to the meeting in general. “Just ‘cause Taylor’s an asshole doesn’t make him wrong, time is short, let’s get a move on! Adriana, Mister Chairman, meeting attendees, distinguished members of Park Privilege,” I say, nodding to each. “I wish to-”   More chatter. “Park – Privilege?” splutters His Halitosisness, jerking forward, rheumy eyes flashing, attempting to stand. His nearer lieutenants join him. “I beg your pardon?”   Aw shit. I do let my mouth run away from me sometimes. That’s my own private name for this place, not its actual one. “Forgive me, it was, er, a reference to the privilege of being here,” I try. “Distinguished members of $witty_camp_name, we must know everything we can about these hippos-” I shout, thumping the table. “I- wait, that pen!” I leap from my chair, dash around the table, run round behind the row of debaters twisting their heads around at me, wiggle my way into the flunkey circle clustering Taylor, squiggle a sneaky hand into his breast pocket, nab that pen I’d asked him for earlier, and I’ve scampered back to my seat before any have a chance to punch me or call me a bitch. I pop the cap off.   “Right. Let’s continue.” I apply nib to notebook 2. “So. How many are there? How are they able to overrun entire countries? This cocaine they take, the new stuff everyone keeps mentioning - what does it do to them? Or the animals they feed it to? Is it normal stuff like any of us might enjoy, or something new? What effects might it have on a human? You wish me to assassinate their ‘leaders’ - they’re not a mindless mob? There’s a hierarchy? Does any spokeshippo speak for all? How-?”   As I rattle off one question after another, the Park’s management slowly cool off from their affront at “privilege”. Staff scurry forward with cakes and pastries, for they know how best to handle their lords’ moods, and the management snatch the things up and sink teeth into ‘em, flashing angry glances at me with descending frequency, then finally flollop into placidity and chew.   “I believe my colleague may be of service to us,” says Adriana. She clinks another emptied cup to table. “Mr. Tsiolovsky, if you please?”   She gestures to a late-middle-aged man slopping around in an office chair like a badly made cocktail. Him! I give a start. He was part of the Congo gang. Don’t let his Rigor Mortis look fool you, in the hovercraft melee he pummelled people like Mike Tyson
